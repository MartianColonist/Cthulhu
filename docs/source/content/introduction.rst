Introduction
------------

This page is split into two sections. The first part [LINK] assumes that the user has
absolutely no idea of the science behind Excalibur. It explains from the very basics
what a cross section is and why it is useful. The second part [LINK] assumes that the
user *does* understand the science, and describes in plain English the many functions that Excalibur
can perform. Even for more knowledgeable users, we recommend taking
the extra few minutes to read both sections when working with Excalibur for the first time.
