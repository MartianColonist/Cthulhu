All of the major end-user functions are contained in the `core.py` file. Thus, to summon the line list, we import the `summon` function `from excalibur.core`. We then specify the species and database. Finally, call the `summon` function, and the line list is downloaded!\n",

As before, Excalibur needs to know the `species` and `database` from which the line list was downloaded. Cross sections are computed at a certain pressure and temperature, so the user must specify the values `P` and `T` as well. Lastly, Excalibur needs to know the top directory level containing downloaded line lists.
