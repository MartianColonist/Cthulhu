In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to do just that, along with plotting all the cross sections on the same graph. We assume the user has read the Quick Start [Insert Link] tutorial already. \n",

    "When computing for a single pressure and temperature we were able to return `nu` and `sigma` and plot the cross section easily (as in the Quick Start guide). For a grid, we need to parse the cross section files and extract the data first. We use the helper function `read_cross_section_file` from `plot.py` to do this. Just assign `nu` and `sigma` as the return values of this function. Call this function for as many of the temperature-pressure combinations we want to plot. The only parameter is the name of the cross section file."
